### Currently searching for a PhD position

Please note that this is a *real* resume, and I'm looking for a PhD
student position at the moment. I made this resume following a recommendation 
that it would effectively showcase my qualifications to prospective supervisors.

***I hold a master's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Fujian Medical University and have 5 years of experience in the field of precision medicine for cancer, specializing in NGS Bioinformatics analysis and statistical work. I am seeking a PhD Position in the field of molecular biology or Bioinformatics related to cancer or other interesting topic. I have participated in multiple research projects and involved in the publication of four papers$^{1-4}$ to date. Specifically, I played a significant role in three studies $^{1, 3-5}$ focused on the analysis of tumor cohort NGS data, where my responsibilities primarily involved data compilation, statistical analysis, and visualization.***

If you are interested in my background and skills, please feel free to contact me.
