### Currently searching for a PhD position

Please note that this is a *real* resume, and I'm looking for a PhD position at the moment. I made this resume following a recommendation 
that it would effectively showcase my qualifications to prospective supervisors.

***I hold a master's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Fujian Medical University and have 5 years of experience in the field of precision medicine for cancer, specialized in NGS bioinformatics analysis and statistical work. I have participated in several research projects and involved in four publications$^{1-4}$ to date. I am seeking a PhD Position in the field of Molecular Biology or Bioinformatics related to cancer or other interesting topic.***

If you are interested in my background and skills, please feel free to contact me.

###  Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (SIBS), Chinese Academy of Sciences

Ph.D. candidate in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

Shanghai, China

2016

- Research direction: Mechanism analysis of post-transcriptional modification process, including RNA splicing and protein ubiquitination modification.
- Performed molecular experiments to explore how QKI-5 protein regulates the ADD3 gene alternative splicing in cancer$^{2}$.
- Explore the role of SPSB1-mediated ubiquitination in the initiation and progression of tumorigenesis.
<!-- - *The decision to quit the Ph.D. position at SIBS was due to a family health emergency and financial responsibilities, later intensified by the loss of my parents, leading to a period of reflection and renewed commitment to research.* -->

Research or Professional Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Medical data analysis

OrigiMed Co., Ltd

Shanghai, China

2018 - 2023

- Performed data visualization for the article’s results, profiling the genomic features and their therapeutic potential in small cell lung cancer$^{4}$.
- Conducted an independent analysis of clinical NGS data from gastric cancer patients, collaborated with others to draft and refine the manuscript, and submit it for publication to investigate therapeutic implications for Chinese patients$^{3}$.
- In the project focused on investigating somatic alterations in solid tumors within the Chinese population to decode their molecular profiles, I served as the main support. My primary responsibilities encompassed data analysis, submission, and assistance in the drafting and revision of the manuscript$^{1}$.
- Assisted in a systematic pan-cancer study of structural variants in oncogenes$^{5}$.
- Collaborated with an AI engineer who developed deep learning algorithms, contributing to the design of an AI model for predicting the presence of gene variants in tumor samples to aid in pharmaceutical recruitment$^{6}$.
- Curated findings or conclusions of precision therapy (targeted/immunotherapy) from literature or guidelines (e.g., NCCN) into an actionable in-house knowledge database.
- Generated real-world data reports, which included gene prevalence, gene variant-related clinical prognosis, and gene-related clinical insights, to support medical or biological professionals.
- Analyzed label-free quantitative proteomics data.
